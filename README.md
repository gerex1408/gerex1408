As a Computer Engineer, my journey has been shaped through a variety of roles that have allowed me to develop both technical and leadership skills in demanding environments. My experiences range from being a research technician at the University of Girona, to working as a full-stack developer at Additio, and as a Frontend developer at Fundcraft. In each of these roles, I've shown myself to be ambitious, motivated, and hardworking, tackling challenges with enthusiasm and determination to deliver high-quality solutions.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to lead projects, strengthening my ability to work in a team and coordinate tasks. I am at ease when communicating with others and adept at task management.

My primary professional goal is to continue to grow and challenge myself in the field of computer engineering, always seeking to learn and improve. I plan to expand my knowledge through a graduate program related to computer science in the United States, and subsequently apply these learnings and experiences in developing innovative and high-impact software solutions.

My passion and dedication extend beyond my career. I do not settle easily and always strive to be the best at what I do, be it in my job or in my hobbies. My perspective is that each experience is an opportunity to learn and grow, and I embrace every challenge with enthusiasm and determination.
